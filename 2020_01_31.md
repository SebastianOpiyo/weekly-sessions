## Agenda

- Welcome Remarks:
    - algo, data structures, design (beginning)
    - later: "ad hoc of computing"
- Introduction (depending on audience size)
- Warm-up live session(?)
- Interviewing Tips, AMA
- AOB


overflow link - https://zoom.us/j/600321159


## Expectations from the Members
- learning algorithms
- how to ace a coding interview
- best practices for conding interviews



## Tips from Dummy Session

> see [code here](samples/rev_charity.js)

- do a dry run first before saying you are done
- first talk through your solution before writing your code
- Listen to interviewer hints
- Ask questions; esp around constraints, eg. in-place reverse for our case
- Start with brute-force solution, if you are not sure about the optimal
    - even if you are sure of the optimal, talk about the b/f and why it's a good idea
- Do a dry run through code

## Extra Tips from Elsis

- Understand the proble. Restate the problem in your own words, to be sure that you truly understand.
    - Look out for edge-cases
    - Use (more) example inputs
- You get to panicking when you focus more on the bits of the solutions that you know/feel you can't do. 
    - break down into smaller chucks, starting with what you know -> to ease your tension
- Do not focus so much with coming up with an optimal solution from the very beginning; can start with brute-force first (_see previous section tip_).
- Keep track of time ‚è±
- You can ask for more hints
- Takes a lot of preparation, use available platforms e.g
    - HackerRank
    - Cracking the Coding Interview Book
    - LeetCode
    - avg, takes to 6 - 7 months to prep
